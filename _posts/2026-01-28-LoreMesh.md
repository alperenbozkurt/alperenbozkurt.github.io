LoreMesh is an AI-powered NPC orchestration system designed for Unity developers to transform static game characters into dynamic, intelligent entities. By bridging the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and game engines, LoreMesh enables NPCs to possess long-term memory, situational awareness, and evolving personalities based on player interactions.

## Core Features

- **Advanced Long-Term Memory**: NPCs remember past interactions and player choices, ensuring consistent and evolving relationships throughout the game.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: A framework for managing multiple AI agents simultaneously, enabling complex social dynamics and group behaviors.
- **Unity Integration**: A developer-friendly C# SDK that allows for seamless integration into Unity projects with minimal setup.
- **Situational Awareness**: Characters process environmental context and game state data to provide relevant, immersive responses.
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A web-based panel for developers to define and manage NPC traits, goals, and knowledge bases effortlessly.

## Technical Details

The platform features a high-performance **Ruby on Rails** backend for orchestration and data management, utilizing **PostgreSQL** for secure persistence. On the client side, it provides a robust **C#** SDK specifically optimized for the **Unity** engine.

LoreMesh offers three subscription tiers to support projects of all scales:
- **Indie Plan**: Perfect for solo developers and small projects.
- **Professional Plan**: Enhanced memory features and higher message limits for growing teams.
- **Studio Plan**: Enterprise-grade solutions for large-scale productions.

Based in **Ankara, Turkey**, LoreMesh aims to set new standards for AI in the global gaming ecosystem by providing accessible yet powerful procedural narrative tools.
