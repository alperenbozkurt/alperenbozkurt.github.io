Phishing is an attempt to seize sensitive information by pretending to be a reliable electronic communication tool. This sensitive information may be private information such as username, password, credit card information. Phishing is typically initiated with a fake email or other electronic media messages. It usually proceeds by redirecting users to a fake website that appears to be real, then asking them to enter their personal information.
