About Me
---

Hello,

I am Alperen Bozkurt. I am someone who has adopted the 'If they could do it, why can't I do better?'. I like to learn new things and deal with "useless things". 

I was born in **Ankara** in 1997. I graduated from **Computer Engineering** undergraduate program at **Fırat University**.

I completed the **[PriviaHub](https://priviahub.com/)**, **[Vidyodan](https://www.vidyodan.com/?shortlink=5b7484e6&pid=website-direct-store&source_caller=ui)**, **[Phishinger](https://phishinger.com/)**, **[Erbab.dev](https://erbab.dev/)** projects.

I am keen on technologies like **Ruby**, **Javascript(Stimulus.js and React)**, **C#(.Net and Unity)**, and **Crystal**. I like to deal with eccentric tasks more than CRUD operations. 

You can contact me at **[mail@alperenbozkurt.net](mailto:mail@alperenbozkurt.net)** address.
