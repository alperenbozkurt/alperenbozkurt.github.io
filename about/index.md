About Me
---

Hello,

I am Alperen Bozkurt. I am someone who has adopted the 'If they could do it, why can't I do better?'. I like to learn new things and deal with "useless things". 

I was born in **Ankara** in 1997. I graduated from **Computer Engineering** undergraduate program at **Fırat University**.

After my undergraduate graduation, I completed the **[PriviaHub](https://priviahub.com/)** software at **Privia Security**. Then I completed the **[Vidyodan](https://www.vidyodan.com/?shortlink=5b7484e6&pid=website-direct-store&source_caller=ui)** project at **[VNGRS](https://vngrs.com/)** company. I went to Melbourne, Australia, to take a short break and improve my English. After, I started working at **[WebServicesPros](https://www.webservicespros.com/)** again. 

I am keen on technologies like **Ruby**, **Javascript(Stimulus.js and React)**, **C#(.Net and Unity)**, and **Crystal**. I like to deal with eccentric tasks more than CRUD operations. You can say me Junior or Senior or Architect.

You can contact me at **[mail@alperenbozkurt.net](mailto:mail@alperenbozkurt.net)** address.
