# JBlog Jekyll Theme

**[JBlog](http://alperenbozkurt.net/JBlog)** is a simple jekyll theme.

I have used this theme in my own php and ruby blogs.I got inspired by [taylantatli](https://github.com/taylantatli/)'s [moon](https://github.com/taylantatli/moon) and [ramme](https://github.com/taylantatli/ramme) themes to use this theme in Jekyll.

I'm not a designer or something, so I'm sure there is a better way to make this theme. But it's working and looks acceptable for different screen sizes. If something looks extremely ugly and you can't resist to fix it, just send me a PR. I will be grateful.

If you like this theme or using it, please give a **star** for motivation.
